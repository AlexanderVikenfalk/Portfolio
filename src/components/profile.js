          I'm a 29-year-old Swedish web developer living in Berlin. My earlier
            jobs included: forklift driving, handing out flyers while dressed as
            Peter Pan, putting on bottle caps on oil bottles and packaging
            sausages at a sausage factory. But now I've given up my dream to
            work at a sausage factory again and instead decided to pursue a
            career in frontend development.

            as well as backend program with focus on C# and the .NET platform.
