#### About this project: 
Second version of my portffolio. This time written in React (although unnecessary it feels better creating the app in React from the start in case I want to expand the project later).

#### Technologies used: 
* **CSS 3** for design.
* **Bootstrap v4** for responsive design.
* **JSX (ES6 / HTML-5)/ React** for structure.

#### Screenshots ####


#### Other remarks ####
The webpage looks decent on small (<700px) and on medium (~1400px) devices. Tested on Google Chrome.
